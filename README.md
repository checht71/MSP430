# MSP430 Projects
This repo is a collection on projects created to utilize the MSP430 microcontroller.

### Basic LED Blink
This is the "hello world" of microcontrollers. This simply blinks the green LED on the board.

### Polling Blink
This code utilizes polling to allow the user to manually turn on and off the LED.

### Button Blink Speed
This code uses button interrupts to change the PWM duty cycle. The duty cycle is linked to the LED on the board.

### Button Based Brightness
This uses the same interrupts and PWM duty cycle to change the apparent brightness of the green LED on the board.

### Keypad
This code allows the MSP to read from a 16 digit keypad.
